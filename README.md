# Counting chair
Counting chairs from map in a text file

# Installation: 
You need python, re, os, argparse  

Download the package and move to the decompressed directory run:
`pip install -e .`

To use the script run (with options):
`chairs_counting`
Options are :
* --d or --dir -> to specify the location of map file if you want to specify one or it will use the files where you are launching the script from
* --o or --out -> to specify the path for outpulfile, by default it is the same folder and append _output to a map file

`chairs_counting`
